\Title{Technical Notes for Bayesian MHDE Brood Size Sampling}

\Title{John Davis, Bret Hanlon}


Let the $H$-posterior be given by
\[
P(\th | g_n) \propto \exp \fbr{ -n H(\fth,g_n) } \pi(\th)
\]
where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\pi$ is the prior
  \item $g_n$ is the density estimator given by
\[
g_n(x) = \left ( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{-1} \right )^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1(X_i=x)}{x}, \text{ and}
\]
  \item $\fth$ is the power series offspring distribution with support $1,2,...$.
\end{itemize}
Following (hooker), 
\[
H(\fth,g_n) = \int G(\delta) \fth
\]
where $\delta = g_n / \fth - 1$. It is required that $G(0)=0, G'(0)=0, G''(0)=1$. Some algebra demonstrates that in the case of the Hellinger Distance, 
\[
G(\delta) = 2[(\delta + 1)^{1/2} - 1]^2
\]
and
\[
G(\delta)\fth = 4 - 4 \sum \sqrt{\fth g_n}.
\]
Let $\bar{n}$ be the number of unique values in the sample of brood sizes $X_1,...,X_n$. Enumerate these unique values by $X'_1,..., X'_{\bar{n}}$. Let $n_j = \sum_{i=1}^n 1(X'_j = X_i)$. Noting $g_n(x)$ is positive only on $X'_j$, we can then write
\begin{align*}
-n HD(g_n,\fth) &= 4n \fbr{ \sum_x \sqrt{\fth g_n} - 1 } \\
&= 4n \fbr{ \sum_x \sqrt{\fth \left ( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^{-1} \right )^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1(X_i=x)}{X_i} } - 1 } \\
&= 4n \fbr{ \sum_{j=1}^{\bar{n}} \sqrt{\fth   \frac{ n_j(X'_j)^{-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^{\bar{n}} n_k (X'_k)^{-1}} }   - 1 }. \\
\end{align*}
This admits alternative expressions for the $H$-posterior:
\[
P(\th | g_n ) \propto \exp \fbr{ 4n \sum_{j=1}^{\bar{n}} \sqrt{\fth   \frac{ n_j(X'_j)^{-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^{\bar{n}} n_k (X'_k)^{-1}} } } \pi(\th)
\]
and
\[
P(\th | g_n ) \propto \left \{ \Pi_{j=1}^{\bar{n}}  \exp \fbr{ \fth   \frac{ n_j(X'_j)^{-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^{\bar{n}} n_k (X'_k)^{-1} } } \right \}^{2n} \pi(\th) 
\]

\section*{Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm}

Define the jump function
\[
J(\th|\th') = logit^{-1}(N(\th',C^2))
\]
where $C$ is a tuning parameter and $N$ is the pdf of a normal distribution with mean $\th'$ and variance $C^2$. Then, accept proposed jump $\th \sim J(\cdot | \th')$ with probability 
\[
\min \fbr{ \frac{P(\th|g_n) J(\th'|\th)}{P(\th'|g_n) J(\th|\th')}  , 1 }
\]
